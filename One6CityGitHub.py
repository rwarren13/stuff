# Finds optimal tours classically and on D-Wave for one 6-city asymmentric traveling salesman problem (TSP)
# Classically places all optimal tours in a set T and then finds lowest energy solutions on D-Wave.
# Purpose is to determine if D-Wave lowest energy solutions are optimal tours.  Comparison of classical optimal tours and D-Wave so;utions is not automated.

# Results from executing this script are reported in "Optimal Solutions of 6-City TSPs" which is a chapter in the book
# "A Closer Look at the Travelling Salesman Problem" to be published in 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

# Classicaly finds all optimal tours for an asymmetric 6-city TSP. Distances are 0, except for 1 distance = -50
# Writes to screen classical results: distance matrix, length of optimal tour, all optimal tours, and number of optimal tours
# Places optimal tours in a set called T. Each tour has 1 in first position.

# Variables that are hard coded: N = 6, positions in a tour x2,...,x6 (x1 = 1 and xi is the number of a city in position i of a tour)
# Print statements with 1 to 6 are hard coded

N = 6 # N is number of cities. Need to loop on N + 1 = 7, as pointed out page 66 "Fundamentals of Python" by Lambert

# Create distance matrix D with all 0s as integers, according to pages 370-373 in Lubanovic "Introducing Python"
import numpy as np
D = np.zeros((N + 1,N + 1), dtype=int) #See pages 5-7 in Numpy User Guide

# Using array for D because arrays are easier to handle than dictionaries or lists.
# To overcome that arrays begin with index 0, will create arrays of size one
# larger than needed and use elements indexed 1 to 6, and not use any elements with index 0.

# Change distance matrix D to an example for which I know the optimal tours

D[1,6] = -50  # There are 24 optimal tours with distance -50 and 96 tours with distance 0

# Print distance matrix
